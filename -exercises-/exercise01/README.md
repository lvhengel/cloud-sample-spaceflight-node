# Exercise 01: Creating a new Business Application using local development tools

## Estimated time

10 minutes

## Objective

In this exercise we will learn to set up our local development environment and create a new node.js project. This will be our codebase to create the Space travel application.

## Exercise description

### Already done for the TechEd session. Proceed to Step 4 of this exercise.

1. Open the command line terminal and install cds command line tool.
```
npm config set @sap:registry https://npm.sap.com
npm i -g @sap/cds
```
Now, the following command should print the version information
```
cds --version
```
### Already done for the TechEd session. Proceed to Step 4 of this exercise.
2. Install cds generator command line tool. The generator creates the basic project structure through an interactive wizard.
```
npm i -g @sap/generator-cds
```
This helps us to use the command, `cds new`, in the next step to create a new project.

### Already done for the TechEd session. Proceed to Step 4 of this exercise.
3. Execute `cds new` command to create a new project by providing the project name as a parameter. Here, let us use `cloud-sample-spaceflight-node` as the project name.
```
cds new cloud-sample-spaceflight-node
```
We will be prompted to select the modules that the project will require. Select the following modules: database and service modules by clicking arrow keys and space bar as shown below.

4. Goto [SAP Development tools page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud) and scroll down to the end to download the CDS extension as shown. Click on the .vsix file and the file download will begin. This may trigger the license agreement popup if you are accessing the page for the first time. Click the `I Have Read And Agree` button and proceed. In case the downloaded file is a zip archive, extract it.

7. Goto the `Explorer` tab (first tab that is highlighted in the screenshot) of VS Code editor. Choose `File` menu and then click on `Open Folder`. Navigate to the path `D:\Files\Session\CNA375\cloud-sample-spaceflight-node\`. This will open the project in VS Code as shown.

The project contains db and srv folders which corresponds to the Database and Service modules. 

Package.json file contains the list of dependencies of the project. The "node_modules" folder contains dowloaded packages of these dependencies in our local develoment environment.
